# advent-of-code-2024

My haskell solutions for advent of code 2024. Please don't pay too much attention to the code quality, I'm well aware it's quite unreadable. I'm just trying to improve my haskell skills whilst having fun with it. Sometimes this means finding some cool but obfuscated solutions.

### Trying out the code

To try the code you can use `nix-shell` in the root directory, and then call `ghc` whatever file to build. This should deal with all dependencies. 

If you don't have nix, good luck! You can find the list of dependencies in the `shell.nix`.
